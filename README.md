# Finite Element Analysis

## Overview

The **Finite Element Analysis** project, conducted as a course project at **IIT Kanpur** under the supervision of Prof. P. M. Mohite from the Department of Aerospace Engineering, focuses on the development and application of finite element codes for various structural problems. The project involves implementing finite element methods for beam bending and elastic bar problems, analyzing structural responses under different conditions, and validating results against theoretical solutions.

## Key Features

- **Finite Element Codes Development**: Created codes for analyzing **beam bending** and **elastic bar** problems using Hermite and Lagrange shape functions.
- **Load Conditions and Boundary Constraints**: Implemented various load conditions and boundary constraints including Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin conditions to simulate real-world scenarios.
- **Structural Analysis**: Analyzed key structural parameters such as **displacement**, **slope**, **shear force**, **bending moment**, and **stress distribution** for various mesh densities.
- **Patch Tests and Error Analysis**: Performed comprehensive patch tests, error analysis, and convergence studies to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the finite element codes.
- **Validation**: Verified the finite element results against Euler-Bernoulli beam theory closed-form solutions to confirm correctness and precision.
- **Automated Post-Processing**: Automated the generation of **continuous** and **discrete visualizations** of primary and secondary variables to aid in result interpretation.
- **Detailed Reporting**: Documented a detailed report highlighting the accuracy, efficiency, and convergence rates of the developed finite element codes.
